# Text-To-Speech-Covertor
I've created the text to speech to converter using python. Where it has simple GUI and with minimal buttons and we can adjust the speed, voice. and it has voice options like Male and Female.

This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to convert text into speech using pyttsx3 (a text-to-speech engine).

Functionality:
Users can input text into a text area.
Options to select gender (Male/Female) and adjust speed (Fast/Normal/Slow).
Uses pyttsx3 to synthesize speech and play it.
The generated speech can also be saved as an audio file (.mp3) to a user-specified location.

GUI Components (Tkinter):
Text area for input.
Dropdown menus (ttk.Combobox) for language, gender, and speed selection.
Buttons: Play, Reset, Download.
Scale widget for adjusting volume.
